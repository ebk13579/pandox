# Pandox

## A collection of PANDOc eXtensions

**Pandox** is a small collection of utilities that extend [John MacFarlane's Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/), the "universal document converter".

### Using

#### The Command Line Interface

The *Pandox* extensions are typically invoked by piping a JSON-formatted AST (generated via `pandoc -t json FILENAME`) in as stdin, and piping the transformed JSON-formatted AST to another pandoc invocation for rendering.  For example:

```console
> pandoc -t json README.md | coffee lib/up-caser.coffee | pandoc -f json -t html
```

will generate an HTML version of the `README.md` file, first applying the filter defined in `up-caser`.

The npm module includes directly executable scripts for each extension.  Hence:

```console
> pandoc -t json README.md | pandox-up-caser | pandoc -f json -t html
```

also works (following `npm install -g pandox`).

Use the `--help` or `-h` command line parameter for more information:

```console
> node lib/pandoc-filter.js --help

Usage: node lib/pandoc-filter.js [OPTIONS] [FILE]

Options:
  -h, --help    Show this help message.
  -f, --filter  A filter to apply before this one. May be repeated.

Examples:
  pandoc -t json FILE.md | node lib/pandoc-filter.js
  pandoc -t json FILE.md > FILE.json && node lib/pandoc-filter.js FILE.json
```

#### The API (Code-Level) Interface

*Pandox* processes the JSON-format abstact-syntax tree that *pandoc* can generate when given the `-t json` flag. The internal API is (intended to be) the same the [*Pandoc* filters API](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/scripting.html) that exists for Haskell and Python.

If you'd like to try your hand at writing custom JavaScript-based *Pandoc* filters, simply extend the `PandocFilter` class or supply a filtering method. For example:

```js
var PandocFilter = require('pandoc-filter');

function upcase(type,content) {
  if(type==='Str') {
    return { t:type, c:content.toUpperCase();
  } else {
    return null;
  }
}

var filter = new PandocFilter(upcase);
```

Several examples can be found in the `./lib` directory.

See the comments in `./lib/pandoc-filter.coffee` (or `./lib/pandoc-filter.js`) for a detailed explanation of the API.

### The Extensions

#### UpCaser

The `UpCaser` filter is a trivial extension primarily intended to serve as an example.

It will convert any string values to upper case, but ignores code blocks, urls, and other special cases.

Usage exmample:

```console
> pandoc -t json README.md | pandox-up-caser | pandoc -f json -t html
```

#### StringCombiner

By default, Pandoc's AST treats each (whitespace-delimited) word as an indepdent block.  For instance, the string:

    Hello World.

is represented in the AST as three separate blocks:

```js
[ { t:'Str',c:'Hello' }, { t:'Space',c:[] }, { t:'Str',c:'World. } ]
```

The `StringCombiner` filter will collapse these sequences of strings and spaces into a single (multi-word) string:

```js
[ { t:'Str',c:'Hello World. } ]
```

Usage exmample:

```console
> pandoc -t json MY-FILE.md | pandox-string-combiner | pandoc -f json -t html
```

#### CodeBlockProcessor

The `CodeBlockProcessor` filter adds several capabilities to the way in which *Pandoc* handles "fenced code blocks", such as:

    ```
    This is a sample of text inside a "fenced" code block.
    ```

*Pandoc* supports several parameters that control the way in which a code block is rendered.  The general form is:

    ```{#THE-ID .CLASS-ONE .CLASS-TWO NAME="VALUE" NAME2="VALUE2"}
    This is a sample of text inside a "fenced" code block.
    ```

where:

  * `#THE-ID` is used to identify the code block in things like HTML anchors and Latex cross-references.

  * `.CLASS-ONE`and `.CLASS-TWO` enumerate HTML classes to assign to the code block, and sometimes influence the rendering in other ways.  For example, adding the class `.numberLines` will cause *Pandoc* to number the lines in the code block when rendering it.

  * `NAME="VALUE"` and `NAME2="VALUE2"` enumerate name-value pairs that can be used to modify the way in which the code block is rendered. For example, adding the pair `startFrom=100` will cause *Pandoc* to number the lines starting with 100 rather than 1.

`CodeBlockProcessor` adds a few new parameters that can be controlled by name-value pairs.

  * `input-file` - replaces the body of the code block with the contents of the specified file.

  * `input-cmd` - replaces the body of the code block with output of the specified command.

  * `exec` - executes the body of the code block as it were a shell script

  * `output-file` - writes the body of the code block to the specified file.

  * `output-cmd` - pipes the body of the code block to the specified command.

Usage exmample:

```console
> pandoc -t json MY-FILE.md | pandox-code-block-processor | pandoc -f json -t html
```
